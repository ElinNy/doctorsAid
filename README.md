Going to make a project with a website that will help a doctor teach kids about a common cold.
The idea is to first having a lesson about a common cold and then using a memory game to implement what the lesson was about.
I'm going to use Typescript and Vite.
This readme may update throughout the project.

npm install
npm run dev

_Planning on uploading a link to the webpage_
